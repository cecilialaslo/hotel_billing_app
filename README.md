# hotel_billing_app
Simple Java app for billing customers of a hotel, for three different services: accommodation, bar, swimming pool. 
It issues separate bills for each service, as well as the bill for the entire stay. Discounts are applied based on customer's membership to the hotel club (platinum/gold/silver/non member).
I built it using POJO classes only (no SQL database), in order to practice OOP concepts, such as inheritance and polymorphism.
